            <p> Whether you're just getting started, or have worked with Spring for years, we think you'll find it rewarding to get involved with the Spring community. It's a big place today, with dozens of Spring projects and millions of users around the world, but we all have something in common: building real-world enterprise applications. You'll find some of the smartest and friendliest folks in the industry here, which means it's a great place to learn and a great place to give back, no matter your level of expertise.</p>

            <p> You can find @Kevoree on Twitter, and certain projects have their own dedicated Twitter accounts, too. Subscribe to and comment on our blogs at blog.kevoree.org, where you'll find in-depth technical articles, release announcements and more.

                    <p>The Kevoree family of projects are built on a foundation of user feedback. If you find a bug, or have a great idea for a feature or improvement, please do report it in our github issue tracker.</p>

                <h2 id="test">TRACK THE LATEST FEATURES AND TEST THEM OUT</h2>
                <p>    Try out the latest snapshot, milestone, or release candidate versions of the Kevoree projects that you use and let us know how it goes! Kevoree releases tend to be rock solid thanks in large part to an eager community constantly testing early and testing often in real world scenarios. Put a watch on the project source repositories that you care about. Subscribe to Github feeds. Subscribe to Hudson CI build plans. While all Kevoree releases are available in our maven release repository, you'll find all pre releases (including nightly snapshots) in our repository manager. Just search for the artifacts you're interested in.</p>

                <h2 id="code">CONTRIBUTE CODE</h2>
                <p>     Today you'll find nearly all Kevoree projects hosted at GitHub. We strongly encourage you to fork Kevoree project repositories that you work with, make changes as you see fit and submit pull requests back to the project team. Fix a bug, correct a typo, or take a shot at an improvement or new feature. Address your own issues, or search through our Github tracker to find what interests you. Every project is a little different, and you'll find complete instructions about building and contributing to individual projects in their respective README files on GitHub. Happy hacking!</p>
